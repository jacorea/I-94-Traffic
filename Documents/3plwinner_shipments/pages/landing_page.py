    ### How to Use This App

    2. **Select the Carrier Page**  
       Use the sidebar to select the correct report type.
       
    3. **Upload and Preview**  
       Upload your CSV and review the data after processing.

    4. **Insert into Database**  
       If everything looks good, click **Insert** to add it to the PostgreSQL database.

    ### Notes:
    - The data must include required fields like `TrackingNumber`, `TotalCharge`, etc.
    - Duplicate `TrackingNumber` entries will be skipped automatically.
    - Each carrier report may have a different format. Be sure to upload them to the correct page.
